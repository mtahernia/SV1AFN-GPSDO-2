# Firmware and Control software for SV1AFN GPSDO-2

The links to the software and firmware are not working in the [product page](https://www.sv1afn.com/en/products/gps-disciplined-oscillator-with-2-clock-rf-output-channels.html) and searching the web I could not find them.

Some people have asked for the software and firmware in the [SV1AFN GPSDO-2 thread](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/rf-microwave/sv1afn-gpsdo/) in the EEVblog forum.

I have the software and firmware for the SV1AFN GPSDO-2 and I am sharing it here.
